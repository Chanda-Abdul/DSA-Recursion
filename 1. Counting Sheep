Write a recursive function that counts how many sheep jump over the fence. 
Your program should take a number as input. 
That number should be the number of sheep you have. 
The function should display the number along with the message "Another sheep jumps over the fence" until no more sheep are left.
Input: 3
Output:
3: Another sheep jumps over the fence
2: Another sheep jumps over the fence
1: Another sheep jumps over the fence
All sheep jumped over the fence
What is the input to the program?3
What is the output of the program? Current number of sheep: Another sheep jumps over the fence
What is the input to each recursive call?3 then 2 then 1 then 0
What is the output of each recursive call? 3 then 5 then 6



const allTheSheep = function howMany(sheep)  {
//base case
if (sheep === 0) {
Return “all sheep jumped over the fence”;
}
//general case
return sheep: “Another sheep jumps over the fence”;
Let sheep = sheep - 1
Return Sheep + howMany(sheep) 
}

let sheep = 3
