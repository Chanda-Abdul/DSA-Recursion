Calculate the nth triangular number. A triangular number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. This is the Triangular Number Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.

What is the input to the program? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
What is the output of the program?1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.
What is the input to each recursive call? If n = 1, then 1, and set current result to 1, then increment n
What is the output of each recursive call? N = n + 1; result + n
