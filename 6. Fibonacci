6. Fibonacci
Write a recursive function that prints the Fibonacci sequence of a given number. The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the 2 preceding numbers. For example, the 7th Fibonacci number in a Fibonacci sequence is 13. 
The sequence looks as follows: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13.

function fibonacci(num) {
  //base case
  if (num === 0) {
    return 0
  }
  //recursive case
  if (num === 1) {
    return 1
  }
  return fibonacci(num-2) + fibonacci(num-1)
  }

console.log(fibonacci(7))
