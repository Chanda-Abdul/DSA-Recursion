Write a recursive function that splits a string based on a separator (similar to String.prototype.split). Don't use JS array's split function to solve this problem.

Input: 02/20/2020
Output: ["02", "20", "2020"]

What is the input to the program? 02/20/2020
What is the output of the program? ["02", "20", "2020"]
What is the input to each recursive call? For the function you would tell it to get all numbers up to the separator and create a string, if there is still data after the separator repeat the function until there is no data left
What is the output of each recursive call? The input separated without the separators

const splitString = function(string, separator) {
  //Base case
if (!string) {
return '';
}
  //recursive case
  let curr = string[0]
  if (curr == separator) {
    curr = ''
  }
  return curr + splitString(string.slice(1), separator)
}

console.log(splitString("02/20/2020", "/"));
