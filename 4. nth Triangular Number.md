# 4. nth Triangular Number

Calculate the nth triangular number. A triangular number counts the objects that can form an equilateral triangle. The nth triangular number is the number of dots composing a triangle with n dots on a side, and is equal to the sum of the n natural numbers from 1 to n. This is the Triangular Number Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.

## What is the input to the program? 
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
## What is the output of the program?
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45.
## What is the input to each recursive call? 
If n = 1, then 1, and set current result to 1, then increment n
## What is the output of each recursive call?
N = n + 1; result + n
